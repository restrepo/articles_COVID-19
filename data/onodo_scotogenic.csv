Radiative Scaling Neutrino Mass and Warm Dark Matter</a><br>
Ernest Ma <br><br>
Abstract A new and radical scenario of the simple 2006 model of radiative neutrino mass is proposed, where there is no seesaw mechanism, i.e. neutrino masses are not inversely proportional to some large mass scale, contrary to the prevalent theoretical thinking. The neutral singlet fermions in the loop have masses of order 10 keV, the lightest of which is absolutely stable and the others are very ...

Light $Z^\prime$ and Dark Matter from U(1)$_X$ Gauge Symmetry.</a><br>
Nobuchika Okada, Satomi Okada, Qaisar Shafi <br><br>
We consider a U(1)$_X$ gauge symmetry extension of the Standard Model (SM) with a $Z^\prime$-portal Majorana fermion dark matter that allows for a relatively light gauge boson $Z^\prime$ with mass of 10 MeV$-$ a few GeV and a much heavier dark matter through the freeze-in mechanism. In a second scenario the roles are reversed, and the dark matter mass, in the keV range or so, lies well below the $...

Multicomponent dark matter particles in a two-loop neutrino model</a><br>
Yuji Kajiyama, Hiroshi Okada, Takashi Toma <br><br>
We construct a loop induced seesaw model in a TeV scale theory with gauged U(1)B−L symmetry. Light neutrino masses are generated at two-loop level and right-handed neutrinos also obtain their masses by one-loop effect. Multi-component Dark Matters (DMs) are included in our model due to the remnant discrete symmetry after the B − L symmetry breaking and the Z2 parity which is originally imposed to ...

Elementary keV sterile Dirac neutrinos can be a natural ingredient of the composite neutrino scenario. For a certain class of composite neutrino theories, these sterile neutrinos naturally have the appropriate mixing angles to be resonantly produced warm dark matter (WDM). Alternatively, we show these sterile neutrinos can be WDM produced by an entropy-diluted thermal freeze-out, with the necessar...

Sterile neutrinos as dark matter</a><br>
Scott Dodelson, Lawrence M. Widrow <br><br>
The simplest model that can accommodate a viable nonbaryonic dark matter candidate is the standard electroweak theory with the addition of right-handed or sterile neutrinos. This model has been studied extensively in the context of the hot dark matter scenario. We reexamine this model and find that hot, warm, and cold dark matter are all possibilities. We focus on the case where sterile neutrinos ...

keV-scale gauge-singlet fermions, when allowed to mix with the active neutrinos, are elegant dark matter (DM) candidates.

In the absence of new physics, this hypothesis is virtually ruled out by astrophysical observations. Here, we show that new interactions amo...

In the former case our bound is comparable to but independent of the Lyman-α bound, and together with the x-ray ...

A Class of Inert N-tuplet Models with Radiative Neutrino Mass and Dark Matter</a><br>
Sandy S. C. Law, Kristian L. McDonald <br><br>
We present a class of models with radiative neutrino mass and stable dark- matter candidates. Neutrino mass is generated by a one-loop diagram with the same topography as Ma's 2006 proposal (which used an inert scalar-doublet and singlet fermion). We generalize this approach and determine all variants with new fields no larger than the adjoint representation. When the neutrino mass diagram contain...

Abstract We show that massive sterile neutrinos mixed with the ordinary ones may be produced in the early universe in the right amount to be natural warm dark matter particles. Their mass should be below 40 keV and the corresponding mixing angles sin22θ>10−11 for mixing with νμ or ντ, while mixing with νe is slightly stronger bounded with mass less than 30 keV.

A class of three-loop models with neutrino mass and dark matter</a><br>
Chian-Shu Chen, Kristian L. McDonald, Salah Nasri <br><br>
Abstract We study a class of three-loop models for neutrino mass in which dark matter plays a key role in enabling the mass diagram. The simplest models in this class have Majorana dark matter and include the proposal of Krauss, Nasri and Trodden; we identify the remaining related models, including the viable colored variants. The next-to-simplest models use either more multiplets and/or a slight ...

A radiative model for the weak scale and neutrino mass via dark matter</a><br>
Amine Ahriche, Salah Nasri, Kristian L. McDonald <br><br>
We present a three-loop model of neutrino mass in which both the weak scale and neutrino mass arise as radiative effects. In this approach, the scales for electroweak symmetry breaking, dark matter, and the exotics responsible for neutrino mass, are related due to an underlying scale-invariance. This motivates the otherwise-independent $$ \mathcal{O}\left(\mathrm{T}\mathrm{e}\mathrm{V}\right) $$

keV sterile neutrino dark matter and neutrino model building</a><br>

A sterile neutrino with a mass around the keV scale could be an interesting candidate for warm dark matter.

Constraints on sterile neutrino dark matter</a><br>
Kevork N. Abazajian, Savvas M. Koushiappas <br><br>
We present a comprehensive analysis of constraints on the sterile neutrino as a dark matter candidate. The minimal production scenario with a standard thermal history and negligible cosmological lepton number is in conflict with conservative radiative decay constraints from the cosmic X-ray background in combination with stringent small-scale structure limits from the Lyman-alpha forest. We show t...

Models with spontaneously broken global lepton number can lead to a pseudo-Goldstone boson as a long-lived dark matter candidate.

For masses above MeV, this model could lead to a detectable flux of monochromatic mass-eigenstate neutrinos, which have flavor ratios that depend strongly on the neutrino mass hier...

We explore the possibility that dark matter interactions with Standard Model particles are dominated by interactions with neutrinos.

From data recently reported from the IceCube telescope, we derive new bounds on the monochromatic neutrino signal produced from dark matter particle decays.

As a result, intensity constraints on neutrino lines at energies above a few TeV are now comparable to thos...

We study the stochastic axion dark matter scenario in the axion landscape, where one of the axions is light and stable and therefore explains dark matter.

Leptogenesis in models with keV sterile neutrino dark matter</a><br>

We analyze leptogenesis in gauge extensions of the Standard Model with keV sterile neutrino dark matter. We find that both the observed dark matter abundance and the correct baryon asymmetry of the Universe can simultaneously emerge in these models. Both the dark matter abundance and the leptogenesis are controlled by the out-of-equilibrium decays of the same heavy right-handed neutrino.

Minimal Dark Matter (MDM) stands as one of the simplest dark matter scenarios. In MDM models, annihilation and co-annihilation processes among the members of the MDM multiplet are usually very efficient, pushing the dark matter mass above O(10) TeV in order to reproduce the observed dark matter relic density. Motivated by this little drawback, in this paper we consider an extension of the MDM scen...

We discuss a simple non-supersymmetric model based on the electroweak gauge group SU(2)L × SU(2)′ × U(1)B-L where the lightest of the right-handed neutrinos, which are part of the leptonic doublet of SU(2)′, play the role of a long-lived unstable dark matter with mass in the multi-PeV range.

The scotogenic model can simultaneously account for the presence of dark matter and the origin of neutrino masses. We assume that the flavor neutrino mass matrix has one zero element and Yukawa matrix elements are real in the scotogenic model. It turns out that only one pattern of the flavor neutrino mass matrix in the one-zero-texture scheme within the scotogenic model is viable with the observed...

Abstract We revisit the calculation of the three-loop diagrams for the radiative neutrino mass generation and consider some relevant constraints on the model recently proposed by Jin et al.

We find that the previous approximation is inappropriate due to the neglect of some important contributions, and the benchmark point proposed can neither give rise to enough neutrino masses nor acc...

Salvador Centelles Chuliá, Ernest Ma, Rahul Srivastava, <i>et al.</i> <br><br>
Abstract We propose to relate dark matter stability to the possible Dirac nature of neutrinos. The idea is illustrated in a simple scheme where small Dirac neutrino masses arise from a type-I seesaw mechanism as a result of a Z 4 discrete lepton number symmetry. The latter implies the existence of a viable WIMP dark matter candidate, whose stability arises from the same symmetry which ensures the ...

We investigate the detection prospects of a non-standard dark sector in the context of boosted dark matter. We consider a scenario where two stable particles have a large mass difference and the heavier particle accounts for most of dark matter in our current universe. The heavier candidate is assumed to have no interaction with the standard model particles at tree-level, hence evading existing co...

We consider the generic possibility that the Universe's energy budget includes some form of relativistic or semi-relativistic dark radiation (DR) with non-gravitational interactions with Standard Model (SM) particles. Such dark radiation may consist of SM singlets or a non-thermal, energetic component of neutrinos. If such DR is created at a relatively recent epoch, it can carry sufficient energy ...

Neutrino decoupling beyond the Standard Model: CMB constraints on the Dark Matter mass with a fast and precise $N_{\rm eff}$ evaluation</a><br>
Miguel Escudero <br><br>
The number of effective relativistic neutrino species represents a fundamental probe of the thermal history of the early Universe, and as such of the Standard Model of Particle Physics. Traditional approaches to the neutrino decoupling are either very technical and computationally expensive, or assume that neutrinos decouple instantaneously. In this work, we aim to fill the gap between these two a...

Dark Matter Annihilation to Neutrinos: An Updated, Consistent & Compelling Compendium of Constraints</a><br>
Carlos A. Argüelles, Alejandro Diaz, Ali Kheirandish, <i>et al.</i> <br><br>
We place updated constraints on dark matter annihilation into neutrinos, using the most recently available data from neutrino detectors. We consider Galactic and extragalactic signals of $s$, $p$, and $d$-wave annihilation processes directly into neutrino pairs, and furthermore provide projections for next-generation neutrino experiments. Our constraints span dark matter masses from MeV to ZeV, ra...

Improved Limits on Sterile Neutrino Dark Matter using Full-Sky Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor Data</a><br>
Kenny C. Y. Ng, Shunsaku Horiuchi, Jennifer M. Gaskins, <i>et al.</i> <br><br>
A sterile neutrino of ∼keV mass is a well-motivated dark matter candidate. Its decay generates an x-ray line that offers a unique target for x-ray telescopes. For the first time, we use the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) onboard the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope to search for sterile neutrino decay lines; our analysis covers the energy range 10–25 keV (sterile neutrino mass 20–50 keV), which is i...

Neutrino propagation in the Galactic dark matter halo</a><br>
P. F. de Salas, Roberto A. Lineros, M. Tórtola <br><br>
Neutrino oscillations are a widely observed and well established phenomenon. It is also well known that deviations with respect to flavor conversion probabilities in vacuum arise due to neutrino interactions with matter. In this work, we analyze the impact of new interactions between neutrinos and the dark matter present in the Milky Way on the neutrino oscillation pattern. The dark matter-neutrin...

Abstract Sterile neutrinos with mass in the range of one to a few keV are important as extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics and are serious dark matter (DM) candidates. This DM mass scale (warm DM) is in agreement with both cosmological and galactic observations. We study the role of a keV sterile neutrino through its mixing with a light active neutrino in rhenium 187 and tritium b...

Production of Sterile Neutrino Dark Matter and the 3.5 keV line</a><br>
Alexander Merle, Aurel Schneider <br><br>
The recent observation of an X-ray line at an energy of 3.5 keV mainly from galaxy clusters has initiated a discussion about whether we may have seen a possible dark matter signal. If confirmed, this signal could stem from a decaying sterile neutrino of a mass of 7.1 keV. Such a particle could make up all the dark matter, but it is not clear how it was produced in the early Universe. In this lette...

We study the possibility of generating tiny Dirac neutrino masses at one loop level through the \textit{scotogenic} mechanism such that one of the particles going inside the loop can be a stable cold dark matter (DM) candidate. Majorana mass terms of singlet fermions as well as tree level Dirac neutrino masses are prevented by incorporating the presence of additional discrete symmetries in a minim...

One-loop radiative seesaw dark matter and neutrinoless double beta decay with two zero flavor neutrino mass texture</a><br>
Teruyuki Kitabayashi, Shinya Ohkawa, Masaki Yasuè <br><br>
We discuss the linkage between dark matter mass in the one-loop radiative seesaw model and the effective neutrino mass for the neutrinoless double beta decay. This linkage, which has been already numerically suggested, is confirmed to be a reasonable relationship by deriving analytical expressions for two zero flavor neutrino mass texture.

Dark matter progenitor: Light vector boson decay into sterile neutrinos</a><br>
Brian Shuve, Itay Yavin <br><br>
We show that the existence of new, light gauge interactions coupled to Standard Model (SM) neutrinos give rise to an abundance of sterile neutrinos through the sterile neutrinos' mixing with the SM. Specifically, in the mass range of MeV-GeV and coupling of $g' \sim 10^{-6} - 10^{-2}$, the decay of this new vector boson in the early universe produces a sufficient quantity of sterile neutrinos to a...

Generalized bottom-tau unification, neutrino oscillations and dark matter: Predictions from a lepton quarticity flavor approach</a><br>

Abstract We propose an A 4 extension of the Standard Model with a Lepton Quarticity symmetry correlating dark matter stability with the Dirac nature of neutrinos. The flavor symmetry predicts (i) a generalized bottom-tau mass relation involving all families, (ii) small neutrino masses are induced a la seesaw , (iii) CP must be significantly violated in neutrino oscillations, (iv) the atmospheric a...

We study the gauged U(1)_(B–L) extensions of the models for neutrino masses and dark matter. In this class of models, tiny neutrino masses are radiatively induced through the loop diagrams, while the origin of the dark matter stability is guaranteed by the remnant of the gauge symmetry. Depending on how the lepton number conservation is violated, these models are systematically classified. We pres...

In the energy range from a few TeV to 25 TeV, upper bounds on the dark matter decay rate into high-energy monochromatic neutrinos have recently become comparable to those on monochromatic gamma-ray lines. This implies the clear possibility of a future double ``smoking gun'' as evidence of the dark matter particle, from the observation of both a gamma and a neutrino line at the same energy. In part...
